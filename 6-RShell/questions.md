1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

The remote client determines when a command's output is fully recieved from a server from serarching for a designated end-of-stream marker like `RDSH_EOF_CHAR`. THe client repeatedly calls `rec()` unill it finds the marker, ensuring that if the data arrives in part, the entire output is actually collected. Tecniques such as using length prefixes or unique delimiters also help in handling partial reads. 

2. This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

Since TCP is a stream protocol and doesn't conserve message boundaries, the networked shell protocal has to define its own message framing. This is normally done by adding a delimiter or by prefixing messages with their length. Without specified boundaries, the receiver could combine parts of different commands or split a single command which can cause errors when processing. 

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

To start, stateful protocals keep session information between requests which means that the server keeps track of context and previous interactions. This can simplify some transactions, but it requires more resources in general. On the other hand, stateless protocols treat each request as independent. It makes them easier to scale, however, it often requires clients to include full context with each request entered. 

4. Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?

UDP is normally used when low latency and minimal overhead are more important than a guaranteed delivery or order (such as real-time applications). The simplicity of it and support for broadcast/multicast makes it perfect for scenarios where occasional packet loss is okay or where the application can implement its own error correction if necessary. 

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

The operating system provides the socket API as a standardized interface for network communications. In general, sockets abstract low-level details of protocals (TCP and UDP) which allows applications to establish connections, send, and get data in a consistent way.
